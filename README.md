Alien Invasion is a simple arcade game that allows you to shoot down alien spaceships. It uses the pygame module and shows how much you can do with just pure Python. To play the game, please run alien_invasion.py and use the left/right arrow keys to navigate your spaceship. Your task is to shoot all the aliens before they reach your ship. Use the space bar to throw bullets. Have fun!
